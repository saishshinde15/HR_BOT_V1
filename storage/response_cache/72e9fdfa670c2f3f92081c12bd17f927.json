As far as possible, the Company operates flexible working arrangements. The home working policy is one of the flexible working options which can be requested by employees; it has been introduced with the aim of providing a better work life balance for all employees. The Company realizes that there are situations where conflict may arise when working from home, so it's important to maintain open communication and adhere to the guidelines set forth in this policy.\n\n**Entitlements & Eligibility:**\n- Employees may request home working arrangements as part of their flexible working options.\n- Eligibility begins upon request and approval by the manager.\n- The probationary period may be extended based on the Company’s discretion.\n\n**Complete Procedures:**\n1. **Request Home Working Arrangements:**\n   - Submit a formal request to your manager outlining your reasons for requesting home working arrangements.\n   - Include a proposed schedule and how you will manage your work commitments.\n2. **Manager Review:**\n   - Your manager will review your request and may request a meeting to discuss your proposal.\n   - They will consider factors such as job role, team requirements, and your past performance.\n3. **Agreement & Monitoring:**\n   - If approved, an agreement will be set up outlining the terms of your home working arrangements.\n   - Performance will be monitored during a probationary period, which may be extended at the Company’s discretion.\n   - Regular check-ins will be scheduled to discuss progress and any challenges.\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- No specific documents are mentioned in the policy for initiating or maintaining home working arrangements.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n- The policy aims to provide flexibility but expects employees to maintain the same level of productivity and communication as if they were working on-site.\n- In case of any conflict or performance issues, the Company reserves the right to request a home visit or require the employee to return to the office.\n\n**Related Policies:**\n- Employees should also refer to the BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policy to understand the security and integrity guidelines for working with personal devices.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Submit a Request:** Contact your manager to discuss your request for home working arrangements.\n2. **Manager Review:** Prepare for a meeting with your manager to discuss your proposal in detail.\n3. **Agreement & Monitoring:** If approved, review the terms of your home working agreement and start the probationary period.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nSources: Home-Working-Policy.docx",
