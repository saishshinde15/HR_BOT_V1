You'll be eligible for sick leave if you're unable to work due to illness or injury. The company will pay your normal salary for the approved number of days in any calendar year, provided you comply with the notification and certification requirements. If you're receiving statutory sick pay (SSP), the company will make full payment, including SSP, but the total will not exceed your normal full basic pay.\n\n- **Emergency Leave:** This is a type of leave you can take for urgent personal matters, such as a family emergency. The policy doesn't specify the exact conditions for emergency leave, but it's generally for situations that require immediate attention and can't be postponed.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Review your leave balance:** Check your leave balance to see how much sick leave and emergency leave you have available.\n2. **Plan ahead:** If you anticipate needing sick leave, make sure to notify your manager in advance and provide the necessary documentation.\n3. **Contact HR:** If you have any questions about your specific situation or need further clarification, don't hesitate to reach out to the HR department.\n\nI found this information in the Sickness-And-Absence-Policy document.
