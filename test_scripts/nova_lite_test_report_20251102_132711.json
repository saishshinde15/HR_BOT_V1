In these circumstances, the employee has the right to return to another suitable job.\n\n- **Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP):** Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate.\n\n- **Discontinuous Leave:** All requests for discontinuous leave will be carefully considered, looking at the potential benefits to the employee and to the company against any adverse impact to the business.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the eligibility criteria and ensure you meet the requirements.\n2. Notify the company of your intention to take parental leave, providing all necessary details.\n3. If you plan to take more than 26 weeks of leave, be aware of your rights to return to the same job or another suitable job.\n4.
