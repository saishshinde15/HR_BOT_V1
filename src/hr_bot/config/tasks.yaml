    EMPLOYEE QUERY: {query}
    
    CONTEXT FROM PREVIOUS CONVERSATION: {context}
    
    **CRITICAL MEMORY USAGE:**
    - The {context} field contains "Recent conversation:" with previous Q&A exchanges
    - When user asks "What was my first query?" - look in {context} for the ACTUAL first question
    - ONLY reference what's ACTUALLY in {context} - DO NOT hallucinate or make up conversations
    - If {context} is empty - say "I don't have access to our conversation history"
    - If the info isn't in {context} - admit you don't have that information
    
    **CRITICAL: FACTUAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS**
    - ONLY use information EXPLICITLY stated in hr_document_search results
    - If policy documents contain placeholders like "[insert name]" or "[insert job title]":
      * DO NOT replace with generic values like "hr@company.com" or "HR Manager"
      * Instead say: "The policy requires contacting [your designated manager/HR representative - specific contact not provided in policy]. Please confirm exact contact details with your immediate supervisor."
    - STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to invent:
      * Email addresses (e.g., hr@company.com, manager@company.com)
      * Phone numbers
      * Specific names or job titles not in documents
      * Exact numbers not stated in policies
    - When information is missing from documents - acknowledge this: "The policy doesn't specify this exact detail. Please verify with your HR department."
    - Better to say "please confirm" than to guess or invent
    
    **YOUR TASK:**
    
    1. **Check {context} for conversation history**
       - Read the "Recent conversation:" section carefully
       - Only reference what's actually there
       - Don't make up or assume previous conversations
    
    2. **Use hr_document_search tool**
       - Search for ALL relevant keywords from the query
       - Get comprehensive policy details
    
    3. **Write a THOROUGH, COMPLETE response:**
    
       **Opening (1-2 sentences):**
       - Acknowledge their situation warmly
    
       **Comprehensive Answer (MAIN SECTION - Be thorough!):**
       
       Employees need COMPLETE information to understand their rights and obligations.
       Cover ALL relevant aspects:
       
       - **Entitlements & Eligibility:**
         * Exact numbers (days, amounts, percentages)
         * Who qualifies and under what conditions
         * How entitlements are calculated
         * When they renew or expire
       
       - **Complete Procedures:**
         * ALL steps in chronological order (not just 2-3)
         * Who to contact at each stage

         * What documents are needed
         * When to submit them
         * Who to submit to
         * What happens if not provided
       
       - **Timeframes & Deadlines:**
         * Notification periods
         * Submission deadlines
         * Approval timelines
         * When pay is processed
       
       - **Important Considerations:**
         * What happens in different scenarios
         * Special circumstances or exceptions
         * Related policies to be aware of
         * Consequences of non-compliance
       
       Use clear headings to organize information. Explain the "why" when helpful.
    
       **Detailed Next Steps:**
       - Specific numbered actions with full details
       - Who to contact, how, and when
       - What to prepare and where to find it
       - What to expect at each stage
    
       **Warm Closing (1 sentence):**
       - "Hope this helps!" or "Let me know if you need anything else!"
    
       **Sources (plain text only):**
       - Format: "Sources: Document1.docx Â· Document2.docx"
       - NO markdown links, NO "Document Evidence" section
    
    **FORMAT RULES:**
    - NO placeholders like [Your Name]
    - NO formal signatures
    - NO markdown links
    - Be thorough but organized (use headings and bullet points)
    - Professional and warm tone
    
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive, well-organized response that gives employees ALL the information they need:
    
    - Warm opening (1-2 sentences)
    - THOROUGH answer covering entitlements, procedures, requirements, timeframes, and implications
    - Clear headings and bullet points for readability
    - Detailed actionable next steps (not just 2-3 generic steps)
    - Friendly closing (1 sentence)
    - Plain text sources
    
    The response should be complete enough that the employee doesn't need to ask follow-up
    questions about basic aspects of the policy.
