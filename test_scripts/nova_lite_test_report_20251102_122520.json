      "response": "I'd be happy to help you understand the parental leave benefits! Let me walk you through the details:\n\n**Policy Information:**\nBased on our company policies, here are the key points regarding parental leave benefits:\n\n1. **Eligibility:** To be eligible for parental leave, you must provide the company with the correct notification, including the names of the parents, the start and end dates of any maternity/adoption leave, the expected and actual dates of birth, the amount of Shared Parental Leave (SPL) each parent intends to take, and a non-binding indication of when the leave will be taken.\n\n2. **Shared Parental Leave (SPL):** SPL gives employees more flexibility to share the available leave and pay in the first year. Employees must give at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice to opt into SPL and must remain on maternity leave for at least two weeks after the birth.\n\n3. **Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP):** Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate. It is up to the parents to decide who is paid the statutory shared parental pay and how it is apportioned between them.\n\n4. **Return to Work:** If the employee is returning to work from shared parental leave and the period of leave taken is more than 26 weeks, they have the right to return to the same job unless it is not reasonably practicable. In such cases, the employee has the right to return to another job that is suitable and appropriate for them.\n\n5. **Discontinuous Leave:** All requests for discontinuous leave will be carefully considered, looking at the potential benefits to the employee and to the company against any adverse impact to the business. Every request will be considered on a case-by-case basis.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the eligibility criteria and ensure you meet the requirements.\n2. If you plan to opt into SPL, give at least 8 weeks\u2019 notice.\n3. Provide the necessary notification to the company as outlined in the policy.\n4. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out to your HR department.\n\nI found this information in the Shared Parental Leave Policy and Maternity Policy documents.

According to our policy, employees can apply for sick leave through the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance, except in emergencies. It's important to inform your reporting manager before taking leave.\n\n- **Emergency Leave:** This is taken for urgent situations that require immediate attention, such as a family emergency or a critical personal matter. The policy allows for leave without approval in such cases, but it's still important to inform your manager as soon as possible.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Review the Policy:** I recommend reviewing the full leave policy document to understand the specific eligibility criteria and procedures for both types of leave.\n2. **Submit Your Request:** If you need to take sick leave or emergency leave, submit your request through the HR portal as soon as possible.\n3. **Inform Your Manager:** Always inform your reporting manager about your leave request to ensure smooth workflow and coverage.\n\nI found this information in the Leave Policy document.
