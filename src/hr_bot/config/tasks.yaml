    Answer the employee's HR question comprehensively by determining whether they need:
    1) POLICY INFORMATION (use RAG tool)
    2) HRMS OPERATIONS (use Apideck tool)
    3) BOTH (use both tools)
    
    **Step 1: Analyze Query Type**
    
    Is this a POLICY QUESTION? (Use hr_document_search)
    - Questions about rules, procedures, guidelines
    - "What is the [X] policy?"
    - "How do I request [Y]?"
    - "Am I eligible for [Z]?"
    - "What are the benefits for [W]?"
    - "Explain the process for [X]"
    
    Is this an HRMS OPERATION? (Use HR System Data Access)
    - Applying for leave/time-off
    - Checking personal balances
    - Viewing requests or status
    - Updating employee information
    - Accessing personal HR data
    - "Apply [X] leave"
    - "What's my [balance/status]?"
    - "Show my [requests/data]"
    - "Update my [information]"
    
    Is this BOTH?
    - User needs policy explanation AND wants to take action
    - Example: "I need sick leave" → explain policy + offer to apply
    
    **Step 2: Tool Selection & Execution**
    
    FOR POLICY QUESTIONS → Use hr_document_search:
    - Search documents for relevant policy information
    - Extract specific details: numbers, timeframes, eligibility, procedures
    - Don't just cite documents - EXTRACT the information
    
    FOR HRMS OPERATIONS → Use HR System Operations:
    - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities
    - Select appropriate action and parameters:
      
      **Viewing Data (READ):**
      * action="list_employees" → See all employees
      * action="get_employee", resource_id="00uwkyi5qsjbfjIt5697" → Get specific employee
      * action="list_time_off_requests" → View all leave requests
      * action="get_time_off_request", resource_id="request_123" → Get specific request
      * action="list_departments" → View departments
      * action="list_payroll" → View payroll records
      
      **Creating Data (CREATE):**
      * action="create_time_off_request", data={employee_id, start_date, end_date, type} → Apply for leave
      * action="create_employee", data={first_name, last_name, email, ...} → Add employee
      * action="create_department", data={name, description} → Create department
      
      **Updating Data (UPDATE):**
      * action="update_employee", resource_id="emp_id", data={field: new_value} → Update employee
      * action="update_time_off_request", resource_id="request_id", data={status, notes} → Modify request
      
      **Deleting Data (DELETE):**
      * action="delete_time_off_request", resource_id="request_id" → Cancel leave
      * action="delete_employee", resource_id="emp_id" → Remove employee
      
    - Include relevant parameters (resource_id, data, filters) based on action
    - For CREATE/UPDATE/DELETE: Confirm with user before executing
    - Handle errors gracefully and explain what went wrong
    
    FOR BOTH → Use both tools:
    1. First use hr_document_search to explain policy
    2. Then use HR System Data Access to take action or show personal data
    3. Combine insights coherently
    
    **Step 3: Format Response**
    
    Structure your answer professionally:
    
    1. **Warm Opening** (1-2 sentences)
       - Acknowledge their question/situation with empathy
       - Example: "I understand you'd like to know about our sick leave policy. Let me help you with that."
    
    2. **Main Answer** (comprehensive)
       
       If POLICY ONLY:
       - Provide detailed policy information extracted from documents
       - Include specifics: numbers, timeframes, eligibility criteria
       - Explain procedures step-by-step
       - Make it actionable
       
       If HRMS OPERATION ONLY:
       - Show the live data/status from HR system
       - For actions: confirm details and execute
       - Present information clearly
       
       If BOTH:
       - Start with policy explanation (from RAG)
       - Then show personal data or take action (from Apideck)
       - Connect both parts smoothly
    
    3. **Actionable Next Steps**
       - What should they do next?
       - Who should they contact if needed?
       - Any deadlines or requirements?
       - Offer to help with the action if applicable
    
    4. **Warm Closing**
       - Empathetic, supportive tone
       - Offer additional help
       - Example: "Please let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like me to help you submit that request!"
    
    **Step 4: Source Citation**
    
    Always cite your sources clearly:
    
    For RAG (Policy Information):
    - Format: "**Sources:** [Document Name 1] · [Document Name 2]"
    - Use actual document names from retrieval
    
    For Apideck (HRMS Data):
    - Format: "**Source:** HR Management System (live data)"
    - Be clear this is real-time personal data, not policy documents
    
    For Both:
    - Separate clearly: "**Policy Source:** [Documents] · **Data Source:** HR System"

    **Critical Guidelines:**
    1. Apideck is an HRMS tool - it has NO policy information, only live employee data and operations
    2. RAG has policy documents - it has NO personal employee data or HRMS functionality
    3. Never confuse the two - they serve completely different purposes
    4. For actions (applying leave), always confirm before executing
    5. Be comprehensive - extract details, don't just cite documents
    6. Show empathy and provide helpful guidance
    7. Make responses actionable with clear next steps
  expected_output: >
    A comprehensive, empathetic response that:
    
    1. **Uses the correct tool(s):**
       - Policy questions → RAG only
       - HRMS operations → Apideck only
       - Combined needs → Both tools
    
    2. **Provides detailed information:**
       - Specific numbers, dates, requirements from policies (RAG)
       - Real-time balances, status, data from HRMS (Apideck)
       - Actionable procedures and next steps
    
    3. **Maintains professional structure:**
       - Warm, empathetic opening
       - Comprehensive main answer
       - Clear next steps
       - Supportive closing
    
    4. **Cites sources appropriately:**
       - Document names for policies
       - "HR System" for live HRMS data
       - Clear separation when using both
    
    5. **Handles actions properly:**
       - Confirms before executing HRMS operations
       - Shows results clearly
       - Guides user through the process
    
    Examples:
    
    Policy Question: "What's the sick leave policy?"
    → Use RAG only → Extract policy details → Provide comprehensive explanation → Cite documents
    
    HRMS Operation: "Apply 3 days sick leave from Jan 10-12"
    → Use Apideck only → Confirm details → Submit request → Show confirmation
    
    Combined: "I'm feeling ill, can I take leave?"
    → Use RAG (explain policy) → Use Apideck (check balance, offer to apply) → Comprehensive response
