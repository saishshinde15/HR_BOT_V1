I'd be happy to help you understand our annual leave policy. \ud83d\ude0a\n\n**Leave Policy Information:**\nBased on our company policies, here are the key points regarding annual leave:\n\n1. **Entitlement**: Employees are entitled to a certain number of annual leave days, which is usually based on their length of service with the company. For example, employees with 1-3 years of service are entitled to 10 days of annual leave per year.\n\n2. **Carryover Limit**: Employees can carry over a maximum of 10 days of unused annual leave from one year to the next. Any leave beyond this limit will be forfeited.\n\n3. **Request Procedure**: All leave requests must be submitted via the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance, except in emergencies. Employees must inform their reporting manager before taking leave.\n\n4. **Leave Without Pay**: If all leaves are exhausted, employees may apply for unpaid leave subject to managerial approval.\n\n5. **Returning to Work**: Employees must return to work on the expected return date unless they advise the Company otherwise. Employees who wish to return to work early must give the Company at least eight weeks\u2019 notice.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Check your leave balance on the HR portal.\n2. Submit your leave request via the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance.\n3.

      "response": "I'm here to help you understand the parental leave benefits! Let me walk you through the key points based on our company policies:\n\n**Policy Information:**\n- **Eligibility:** To be eligible for shared parental leave, the employee must provide the correct notification at least eight weeks before the date they wish to start the leave. The notification should include the names of the employee and the other parent, the start and end dates of any maternity/adoption leave or pay, the expected and actual dates of birth, the amount of shared parental leave each parent intends to take, and a non-binding indication of when the employee expects to take the leave.\n- **Statutory Shared Parental Pay (ShPP):** Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate. It is up to the parents to decide who is paid the statutory shared parental pay and how it is apportioned between them.\n- **Return to Work:** If the employee is returning to work from shared parental leave and the period of leave taken is more than 26 weeks, when added to any other period of shared parental leave, statutory maternity or paternity leave taken in respect of the same child, or was the last of two or more consecutive periods of statutory leave that included a period of ordinary parental leave of more than four weeks, or a period of additional maternity leave, the employee has the right to return to the same job unless this is not reasonably practicable. In these circumstances, if it is not reasonably practicable for the Company to allow a return to the same job, the employee has the right to return to another job that is suitable and appropriate for him or her.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. **Review the Policy Documents:** I recommend reviewing the Shared Parental Leave Policy and Maternity Policy documents for detailed information.\n2. **Contact HR:** If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to contact the HR department.\n\nI hope this helps!

      "response": "I'd be happy to help you understand the difference between sick leave and emergency leave!\n\n**Policy Information:**\n\nBased on our company policies, here are the key differences:\n\n- **Sick Leave:** This is leave taken due to illness or injury. Employees must request sick leave via the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance, except in emergencies. Sick leave is subject to managerial approval and may require a medical report. Employees are eligible for sick pay during this leave, but the company reserves the right to terminate employment if abuse is detected.\n\n- **Emergency Leave:** This is leave taken for urgent, unforeseen circumstances that require immediate attention. Emergency leave does not require advance notice and can be requested at any time. Employees should inform their manager as soon as possible. Emergency leave is typically unpaid unless otherwise specified by the company.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Requesting Leave:** To request sick leave, submit your request via the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance. For emergency leave, inform your manager as soon as possible.\n2. **Documentation:** For sick leave, you may need to provide a medical report. For emergency leave, provide details of the emergency situation.\n3. **Approval:** Both types of leave require approval from your manager and HR.\n\nI found this information in the Leave Policy document and Sickness and Absence Policy document.
