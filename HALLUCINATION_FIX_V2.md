# Agent Hallucination Fix - Version 2.1

## Problem Identified

The HR Bot was **inventing contact information** that doesn't exist in policy documents:
- **Hallucinated email**: `hr@company.com` 
- **Root cause**: Policy documents contain unfilled template placeholders like `[insert name]` and `[insert job title]`
- **Agent behavior**: Instead of acknowledging placeholders, the agent was filling them in with generic contact details

## Example of Hallucination

**User query**: "What is the sick leave policy?"

**Agent response (BEFORE FIX)**:
```
**Complete Procedures:**
1. Notify your manager within 1 hour of your absence starting.
2. Email HR within 24 hours at hr@company.com with expected return date if known.
3. Provide a medical certificate if absent 3+ consecutive days.
```

**Problem**: `hr@company.com` appears NOWHERE in the source documents!

**Actual document text** (from Sickness-And-Absence-Policy.docx):
```
"If an employee is unable to come to work for any reason, they must inform the Company by contacting [insert job title]..."
```

The `[insert job title]` is a **template placeholder** that was never filled in by the company.

## Fix Implemented

### 1. Updated `agents.yaml` - Added Strict Factual Accuracy Rules

**Location**: `src/hr_bot/config/agents.yaml`

**Changes**:
```yaml
**CRITICAL: FACTUAL ACCURACY RULES - NO HALLUCINATIONS**
- ONLY use information DIRECTLY from hr_document_search results - never invent or assume
- If policy documents contain PLACEHOLDERS like "[insert name]" or "[insert job title]" - DO NOT fill them in with generic values
- EXPLICITLY STATE when contact details are not specified: "The policy documents indicate you should contact [your manager/HR department - specific name not provided in policy]. Please check with your direct manager for the exact contact information."
- NEVER invent these details (STRICTLY FORBIDDEN):
  * Email addresses (hr@company.com, manager@company.com, etc.)
  * Phone numbers
  * Person names or job titles
  * Specific contact details not in documents
- If a procedure says "contact [insert name]" - preserve this and say: "The policy requires you to contact your designated manager or HR representative. Please confirm the specific contact person with your immediate supervisor."
- If exact numbers/timeframes are NOT in search results - say "The policy documents don't specify this exact detail. Please verify with your HR department."
- When in doubt - err on the side of saying "please verify" rather than inventing information
```

### 2. Updated `tasks.yaml` - Strengthened Output Requirements

**Location**: `src/hr_bot/config/tasks.yaml`

**Changes**:
```yaml
**CRITICAL: FACTUAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS**
- ONLY use information EXPLICITLY stated in hr_document_search results
- If policy documents contain placeholders like "[insert name]" or "[insert job title]":
  * DO NOT replace with generic values like "hr@company.com" or "HR Manager"
  * Instead say: "The policy requires contacting [your designated manager/HR representative - specific contact not provided in policy]. Please confirm exact contact details with your immediate supervisor."
- STRICTLY FORBIDDEN to invent:
  * Email addresses (e.g., hr@company.com, manager@company.com)
  * Phone numbers
  * Specific names or job titles not in documents
  * Exact numbers not stated in policies
- When information is missing from documents - acknowledge this: "The policy doesn't specify this exact detail. Please verify with your HR department."
- Better to say "please confirm" than to guess or invent
```

### 3. Updated Example in `agents.yaml`

**Before** (bad example):
```
**Notification Requirements:**
- Contact your manager within 1 hour of your absence starting
- Email HR at hr@company.com within 24 hours  ❌ HALLUCINATED!
```

**After** (good example):
```
**Notification Requirements:**
- Contact your immediate manager within 1 hour of your absence starting
- The policy requires formal notification to HR/your designated contact (specific contact details should be confirmed with your manager)  ✅ HONEST!
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Agent response (AFTER FIX)**:
```
**Complete Procedures:**
1. Notify your immediate manager within 1 hour of your absence starting.
2. The policy requires formal notification to your HR representative or designated contact. Please confirm the exact contact person and method (email/phone) with your manager as the policy document uses template placeholders.
3. Provide a medical certificate if absent 3+ consecutive days.
```

**Key improvements**:
- ✅ No invented email addresses
- ✅ Acknowledges template placeholders exist
- ✅ Directs user to confirm with their manager
- ✅ Maintains transparency about what's in the documents vs. what's not

## Testing Required

To verify the fix:

1. **Clear any cached memory** (already done - `storage/long_term_memory.db` doesn't exist)

2. **Test via Streamlit UI**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/saish/Downloads/PoC_HR_BoT/hr_bot
   uv run streamlit run src/hr_bot/ui/app.py
   ```

3. **Ask test questions**:
   - "What is the sick leave policy?"
   - "How do I notify HR about my absence?"
   - "Who should I contact for annual leave?"

4. **Verify NO hallucinated contact info**:
   - ❌ Should NOT see: `hr@company.com`, `manager@company.com`, specific phone numbers
   - ✅ Should see: "please confirm with your manager", "designated contact", "verify with HR department"

## Impact Assessment

### ⚠️ What Would Have Happened Without This Fix

**Scenario**: Employee relies on bot's answer and emails `hr@company.com`

**Consequences**:
1. **Email bounces** - address doesn't exist
2. **Employee misses notification deadline** - thinks they notified HR but didn't
3. **Policy violation** - absence recorded as unauthorized
4. **Potential disciplinary action** - for "failing to follow notification procedures"
5. **Loss of sick pay** - may not receive entitled benefits
6. **Trust damage** - employee loses confidence in HR bot accuracy

**Real-world impact**: An employee could lose pay or face disciplinary action because they trusted hallucinated contact information from the bot!

### ✅ Benefits of This Fix

1. **Factual accuracy**: Only information from actual documents
2. **Transparency**: Clear when details need verification
3. **User guidance**: Directs to correct information source (manager)
4. **Trust preservation**: Bot admits limitations rather than misleading
5. **Risk mitigation**: Prevents incorrect actions based on false information

## Files Modified

1. `src/hr_bot/config/agents.yaml` - Added 18 lines of factual accuracy rules
2. `src/hr_bot/config/tasks.yaml` - Added 15 lines of output requirements
3. `src/hr_bot/config/agents.yaml` - Updated example to remove hallucinated email

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Configuration updated
2. ⏳ Test via Streamlit UI (user to verify)
3. ⏳ Run multiple policy queries to ensure no hallucinations
4. ⏳ Once verified, push to GitHub as version 2.1
5. ⏳ Tag release: `git tag -a v2.1 -m "Fix: Prevent agent from hallucinating contact information"`

## Version History

- **v1.0**: Initial HR Bot with basic RAG
- **v2.0**: Added premium UI, long-term memory, removed edit buttons
- **v2.1**: **CRITICAL FIX** - Prevented contact information hallucination

**Status**: ⚠️ **READY FOR TESTING** - Configuration updated, awaiting user verification via Streamlit UI before GitHub release.
