# Tool Invocation Fix - Root Cause Analysis

## Problem Summary
Agent was not invoking tools properly - outputting tool planning text instead of actually calling tools and completing responses.

## Root Cause
**Memory system was injecting past conversation examples** into the prompt that contained tool planning format examples (`Action: [hr_document_search]`). The LLM was learning from these examples and mimicking the format literally instead of actually invoking tools through CrewAI's tool system.

## Evidence

### Test Results

1. **With Memory Disabled + Minimal Agent** = ✅ WORKS
   - Tool was invoked successfully
   - Agent produced complete final answer
   - No incomplete "Observation:" markers

2. **With HrBot (has embedded prompt examples)** = ❌ FAILS
   - Massive prompt with conversation examples visible in error output
   - Agent outputs tool planning text but doesn't invoke tool
   - Response ends with incomplete "Observation:"

## Solution

### Implemented
1. ✅ **Disabled CrewAI Memory** in `crew.py`:
   ```python
   memory=False,  # TEMPORARILY DISABLED: Memory context overwhelming model
   ```

###  Required Next Steps
2. **Simplify Agent Prompt** in `agents.yaml`:
   - Remove or significantly reduce example conversations
   - Remove any examples showing tool invocation format
   - Keep instructions minimal and clear
   - Let CrewAI handle tool formatting natively

3. **Alternative: Use Different Model**:
   - Nova Micro appears sensitive to prompt contamination
   - Claude Haiku would work but requires Bedrock use case form
   - Consider switching to OpenAI GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens
- CrewAI builds prompts with task context, agent backstory, and examples
- When memory is enabled, it injects past conversations
- If those conversations contain tool planning text, LLM learns the wrong pattern
- LLM starts generating planning text as output instead of triggering tool execution

### The Difference
- **Correct**: LLM signals tool use → CrewAI intercepts → Tool executes → Results returned → LLM generates final answer
- **Incorrect**: LLM generates text that *looks like* tool planning → No interception → No execution → Incomplete response

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Clear all memory/cache** before testing:
   ```bash
   rm -rf hr_bot/storage/memory/
   rm -rf hr_bot/storage/response_cache/
   ```

2. **Test with minimal agent first**:
   - Simple role/goal/backstory
   - Single tool
   - No examples in prompt
   - Memory disabled

3. **Gradually add complexity**:
   - Add detailed instructions
   - Re-enable memory only if needed
   - Monitor for tool execution in verbose output

## Status
- ✅ Root cause identified
- ✅ Memory disabled
- ⏳ Agent prompt simplification pending
- ⏳ Full testing pending

## Next Actions
1. Simplify `agents.yaml` prompt (remove examples)
2. Test tool invocation with simplified prompt
3. If works: Re-enable memory cautiously
4. If still fails: Consider model switch
