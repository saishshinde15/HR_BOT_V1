  "response": "I'm happy to help you understand the maternity leave policy. Here's everything you need to know:\n\n**Entitlements & Eligibility:**\n- All employees are entitled to up to 52 weeks' maternity leave, consisting of 26 weeks' ordinary maternity leave (OML) and 26 weeks' additional maternity leave (AML).\n- There is no length of service requirement for eligibility.\n\n**Complete Procedures:**\n1. Notify your line manager as soon as you feel able to do so when you become pregnant. This allows for health and safety considerations.\n2. Employees have the right to time off to accompany a pregnant woman to up to two antenatal care appointments, if the employee is the father of the baby, or the partner of the pregnant woman. There is no right to be paid for this time off and the employee can take a maximum of six and a half hours for each appointment.\n3. If you are returning to work from maternity leave and the period of leave taken is more than 26 weeks, when added to any other period of shared parental leave, statutory maternity or paternity leave taken in respect of the same child, or was the last of two or more consecutive periods of statutory leave that included a period of ordinary parental leave of more than four weeks, or a period of additional maternity leave, you have the right to return to the same job unless this is not reasonably practicable. In these circumstances, if it is not reasonably practicable for the Company to allow a return to the same job, you have the right to return to another job that is suitable and appropriate for you.\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\n- There are no specific documentation requirements for maternity leave. However, please notify your line manager as soon as you become pregnant.\n\n**Timeframes & Deadlines:**\n- There are no specific notification periods or deadlines for maternity leave. However, please notify your line manager as soon as you feel able to do so when you become pregnant.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n- If you take maternity leave, you are not eligible for shared parental leave for that child.\n- Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Notify your line manager as soon as you feel able to do so when you become pregnant.\n2. If you are the father of the baby, or the partner of the pregnant woman, you have the right to time off for antenatal care appointments.\n3. If you are returning to work from maternity leave, you have the right to return to the same job unless this is not reasonably practicable.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nSources: Maternity-Policy.docx · Shared-Parental-Leave-Policy.docx · Paternity-Leave-Policy-Birth.docx",
