There is no right to be paid for this time off and the employee can take a maximum of six and a half hours for each appointment.\n\n**Complete Procedures and Requirements:**\n\n- On becoming pregnant, an employee should notify her line manager as soon as she feels able to do so. This is important because there are health and safety considerations for the employee and the Company.\n- Employees should give at least eight weeks’ written notice to end their maternity leave and opt into Shared Parental Leave (SPL) if eligible.\n\n**Timeframes and Deadlines:**\n\n- Employees must remain on maternity leave until at least two weeks after the birth before opting into SPL.\n- Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n- If the employee is returning to work from shared parental leave and the period of leave taken is more than 26 weeks, when added to any other period of shared parental leave, statutory maternity or paternity leave taken in respect of the same child, or was the last of two or more consecutive periods of statutory leave that included a period of ordinary parental leave of more than four weeks, or a period of additional maternity leave, the employee has the right to return to the same job unless this is not reasonably practicable.\n- Employees who wish to change their hours or other working arrangements on returning from adoption leave should make a request under the Flexible Working Policy.\n\n**Specific Next Steps:**\n\n1. Notify your line manager as soon as you feel able to do so.\n2. If you are eligible for Shared Parental Leave, provide at least eight weeks’ written notice to end your maternity leave and opt into SPL.\n3. Ensure you have the correct notification and information ready to provide to the Company regarding the birth and any leave taken.\n\nLet me know if you need anything else!\n\nSources: [1] Shared-Parental-Leave-Policy.docx · [2] Maternity-Policy.docx\n```",
