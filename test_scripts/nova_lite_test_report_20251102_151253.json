Sick leave is typically paid, depending on the company's sick pay policy.\n\n- **Emergency Leave**: This is leave taken for urgent and unforeseen circumstances, such as a family emergency, a natural disaster, or a personal crisis. Emergency leave is usually unpaid unless the company has a specific policy for paid emergency leave. Employees must notify their manager as soon as possible and provide documentation to support their leave request.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1. **Review the Policy Documents**: I found this information in the Home-Working-Policy and Leave_Policy documents. I recommend reviewing these documents for more details.\n2. **Submit a Leave Request**: If you need to take sick leave or emergency leave, submit your request via the HR portal at least 5 working days in advance, except in emergencies.\n3. **Provide Documentation**: Ensure you provide the necessary medical or emergency documentation to support your leave request.\n\nI hope this helps!
