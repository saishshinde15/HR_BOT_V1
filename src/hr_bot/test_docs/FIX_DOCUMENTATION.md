Demonstration of Agent Reasoning Leak Fix
==========================================

This document shows what the fix does to prevent agent reasoning leaks.

## Problem
When the RAG tool returned "NO_RELEVANT_DOCUMENTS", the agent sometimes leaked 
its internal reasoning process to the user, showing text like:

```
---
Thought: The master_actions_guide did not provide specific steps for reporting sexual
harassment, which is unusual. I will proceed with the hr_document_search results to see
if there are any relevant policies.

Observation:

Sources: View Leave Balance
```

This is unprofessional and confusing for users.

## Solution
We implemented THREE layers of protection:

### Layer 1: Agent Configuration (agents.yaml)
Added explicit instruction:
```yaml
8. ⚠️ NEVER expose internal reasoning - Your response should ONLY contain the final answer for the user.
   DO NOT include "Thought:", "Action:", "Observation:", or "---" separators in your response.
   If tool fails or returns no results, handle it gracefully with the fallback message above.
```

### Layer 2: Task Instructions (tasks.yaml)
Added rule:
```yaml
- **If tool returns "NO_RELEVANT_DOCUMENTS" or fails:** Use the exact fallback message specified in your backstory.
  DO NOT try to improvise, DO NOT add suggestions, just use the fallback message and stop.
```

### Layer 3: Post-Processing Cleaner (crew.py)
Added `_clean_agent_reasoning_leaks()` method that:
1. Detects reasoning markers: "Thought:", "Action:", "Observation:", "---"
2. Strips everything after the first marker
3. Returns professional fallback message if nothing left

```python
def _clean_agent_reasoning_leaks(self, text: str) -> str:
    """
    Remove exposed agent reasoning from responses.
    This prevents users from seeing internal agent workflow when tools fail.
    """
    reasoning_markers = [
        "---\\nThought:",
        "---\\nAction:",
        "---\\nObservation:",
        "\\nThought:",
        "\\nAction:",
        "\\nObservation:",
    ]
    
    has_reasoning_leak = any(marker in text for marker in reasoning_markers)
    
    if has_reasoning_leak:
        # Extract everything BEFORE the first reasoning leak
        lines = text.split('\\n')
        clean_lines = []
        
        for line in lines:
            if line.strip().startswith(('---', 'Thought:', 'Action:', 'Observation:')):
                break
            clean_lines.append(line)
        
        cleaned_text = '\\n'.join(clean_lines).strip()
        
        # If nothing left, provide fallback
        if not cleaned_text or len(cleaned_text) < 50:
            return (
                "I apologize, but I encountered an issue while processing your request. "
                "This might be due to unclear search results or a technical issue. "
                "Please try rephrasing your question, or contact your HR department directly for assistance.\\n\\n"
                "Is there anything else I can help you with?"
            )
        
        return cleaned_text
    
    return text
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

**Before Fix (BAD):**
```
---
Thought: The master_actions_guide did not provide specific steps...
Observation:
Sources: View Leave Balance
```

**After Fix (GOOD):**
```
I understand you're concerned about a colleague experiencing sexual harassment. 
This is a serious matter that requires immediate attention.

**Policy Information**
According to our Sexual Harassment Policy:
- All employees have the right to a workplace free from harassment
- Reports should be made to your manager or HR department
- All complaints are investigated promptly and confidentially

**Next Steps:**
1. Document the incidents with dates, times, and descriptions
2. Report to your manager or HR representative immediately
3. If you witness harassment, you can file a complaint on behalf of a colleague
4. The company has a zero-tolerance policy for retaliation

Is there anything else I can help clarify?

## Testing
Run: `python test_reasoning_leak_fix.py`

Expected: ✅ PASSED: No reasoning leaks detected

## Status
✅ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for production
