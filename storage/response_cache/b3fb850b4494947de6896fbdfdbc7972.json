  "response": "I'm sorry to hear you're wondering about carrying over unused vacation days. Here's everything you need to know based on our company policies:\n\n**Vacation Leave Carry Forward**\n\n- **Entitlement:** Employees are entitled to carry forward up to the applicable amount days of untaken holiday entitlement to the next holiday year, in exceptional circumstances only. This applies for one year only, and holiday may not be carried forward to a subsequent holiday year. \n\n- **Procedure:** \n   - If you are sick or injured while on holiday, the Company will allow you to transfer to sick leave and take replacement holiday at a later date. \n   - You must contact HR Representative in person and by telephone (if possible) as soon as you know that your holiday will be affected by sickness or injury. \n   - The full period of your incapacity due to sickness or injury must be certificated by a qualified medical practitioner, where it exceeds seven days.\n\n**Important Notes:** \n- Generally, all holiday must be taken in the year in which it is accrued. \n- Emergency leave, maternity, paternity, parental and adoption leave are dealt with in their respective policy documents.\n- Unauthorised absence is likely to be treated as a disciplinary offence.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you need anything else.\n\nSources: [1] Sickness-And-Absence-Policy.docx, [3] Home-Working-Agreement.docx",
