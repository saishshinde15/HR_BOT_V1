The employee must provide the company with the necessary information, including the names of both parents, the expected and actual birth dates, and the amount of leave each parent intends to take.\n\n2. **Notification:** Employees must give at least 8 weeks' notice to opt into shared parental leave. They must also remain on maternity leave for at least two weeks after the birth.\n\n3. **Statutory Shared Parental Pay:** Any statutory shared parental pay due during shared parental leave will be paid at a rate set by the Government for the relevant tax year, or at 90% of the employee's average weekly earnings, if this figure is lower than the Government's set weekly rate.\n\n4. **Return to Work:** If the employee is returning to work from shared parental leave and the period of leave taken is more than 26 weeks, they have the right to return to the same job unless it is not reasonably practicable. In such cases, they have the right to return to another suitable and appropriate job.\n\n5. **Discontinuous Leave:** All requests for discontinuous leave will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Agreeing to one request will not set a precedent or create the right for another employee to be granted a similar pattern of SPL.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review the eligibility criteria and ensure you meet all the requirements.\n2. Notify your manager and the HR department at least 8 weeks in advance if you plan to take shared parental leave.\n3.

The exact number of days may vary depending on your employment status and the specific terms outlined in the policy.\n  \n- **Notification:** It's important to notify your manager as soon as possible if you are unable to come to work due to illness.

If you are unable to return to work, you should keep your manager informed of your situation and any expected return date.\n\n- **Continuous Payment:** If the Company makes full payment during times of illness or injury, this includes any entitlement to statutory sick pay (SSP).
